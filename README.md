# [ info ]
When I saw Konas 1.0 I thought that it might actually be good and as a result of 3 months of silence the client might've actually become good.

I was quickly disappointed to see that the client actually became worse.

Modules are now even more broken, new GUI styles look very bad, and it looks like 3 months went into making good ESP.

Konas still isn't worth $15, and you can download [RusherHack](https://github.com/PlutoSolutions/John/blob/main/README.md) for free which is still superior compared to this shit client.

# [ how-to ]

Konas developers somehow made everything worse in the rewrite, not only the client but also security

</div>

1. Download konsaloader.jar from [releases](https://github.com/PlutoSolutions/KonasRewrite/releases) page
0. Put it into your .minecraft/mods folder
0. Start the game
